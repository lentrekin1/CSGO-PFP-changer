# CSGO-PFP-changer
This changes your steam pfp on csgo kill or button press (default "]") (spooky)

## How to use
*add setup steps*

-run program

-open csgo

-profit

-press stop_key (default: "=") to stop the program

## info
It works by constantly looking for button press or looking for csgo kill bar when you kill someone (uses red outline to detect when its your kill so _don't_ disable that)
  
It detects kills most of the time, but false positives (ie. when you get killed)

It pulls a random image file from images/

It plays a sound (alert.wav) every time it switches PFP's so you know when it happens

## todo
-(maybe) change so rather than pulling random image from dir, it gets random image from website

-reduce false positives

-allow for faster keyboard checking without key input

-add for cli/gui support and make it easier to set certain options

-make setup easier

-add error handling
